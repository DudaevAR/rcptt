<h1>Q7 Licensing</h1>
<p>Q7 licenses for professional edition are just HTTP URLs to Q7 License server 
(either global or installed in company's intranet) and the primary usage is 
the floating license mode.
</p>
<p>
That's it, even if you are the sole user of Q7 license, it is very likely that you
would like to use this license on different machines (for example to use it on 
different operating systems), therefore it is simple and safe to use the same license URL
on all machines. However, if you are going to use the license offline, you can always use
license borrowing mechanism to get it on your machine for any period of time
